A simulation game for a Coast Guard search and rescue effort. 

Players will use Bayesâ€™ rule to guide their decisions so they can locate the sailor as quickly as possible.

For this project, it is assumed that three search areas are already identified. It is also assumed that
the player has sufficient resources to explore two of the three areas. 
The project then applies Bayes' rule to decide where to look. 

The project demonstrates work with popular computer vision and data science tools like Open
Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and NumPy.
